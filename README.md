# A simple CRUD application using React JS

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Scope and Objective

The main objective to create this app was to have a hands-on exercise of using
the React concepts into action. The React concepts learnt and used in this project are:

* React Functional Components
* Hooks (useState and useEffect)
* Routing 
* Form Handling (Controlled Components)
* AJAX using fetch

## Libraries Used

The following libraries were used for this application.

* react-router (for basic and dynamic routing)
* react-bootstrap and bootstrap (to have a basic UI structure)
* json-server (to quickly create a fake REST API for prototyping and mocking purpose)

## Future Scope 

* Implement the same project using Redux or Context API
* Include a cloud-hosted database like Firebase
* Deploy the application
* Include additional features to the CRUD application
